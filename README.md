## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  

The repository is organized as follows:  

| Project Name               | Description                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cartoonish_Image_Convertor** | Convert real-life images into cartoonish versions using image processing and deep learning techniques.      |
| **Book_Recommendation**    | Build a recommendation system that suggests books based on user preferences and similarity measures.          |
| **Face_Detection**         | Detect faces in images or videos using state-of-the-art face detection models like Haar Cascade and MTCNN.    |
| **GDP_Prediction**         | Predict a country's GDP based on historical data and machine learning regression models.                      |
| **Image_Preprocessing**    | Perform essential image preprocessing tasks such as resizing, normalization, augmentation, and more.          |
| **Object_Detection**       | Identify and locate objects within images using YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN frameworks.                       |
| **Sentiment_Analysis**     | Analyze and classify text data to determine sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using NLP techniques.  |
